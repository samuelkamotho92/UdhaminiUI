➡️To bridge the gap we have come up with "Udhamini web app". Despite many Scholarships being available nationally and internationally, most go unclaimed, since most students who might be interested in such programs simply are not aware of their existence. Udhamini web app solves this problem by availing the scholarship to prospective students. All the student is required is upon visit the web app make a profile of their interests and the web app will automatically update their available scholarship all over the world. The web app will fetch scholarship from numerous websites, continuously update them and sort them according to user’s profiles

➡️The app will generate income primarily through members’ subscriptions on a monthly or annual basis (have 3 subscription tiers, basic, secondary, and tertiary) and, through affiliate marketing.
